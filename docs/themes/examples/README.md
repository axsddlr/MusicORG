# Theme Examples

This directory is reserved for sample theme packages to help users start quickly.

Suggested sample themes:
- `minimal-dark/` (close to default, easy to compare)
- `high-contrast/` (accessibility-focused palette)
- `spotify-dark/` (already shipped as built-in reference in app source)

Each example should include:
- `manifest.json`
- `tokens.json`
- optional `fonts.json`
- optional `overrides.qss`
- `README.md` with screenshots and rationale
